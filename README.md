## Quick Start

Below you can find the quick start guide for development.

### Set up the environment

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Set up the environment:

```bash
make setup
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Additional first-time setup

1. After setting up the environment, commit the `uv.lock` file to your repository, so that the workflow on github can use it.
2. Enable [Pre-Commit CI](https://pre-commit.ci/) for your repository.
3. Enable **Github Pages** for your documentation.
   To do that, go to the _Settings_ tab of your repository and scroll down to the _GitHub Pages_ section.
   For the _Source_ option, select _GitHub Action_. Done!

### Install new packages

To install new PyPI packages, run:

```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

To add dev-dependencies, run:

```bash
uv add --dev <package-name>
```

### Documentation

The Documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

To view the documentation locally, run:

```bash
make docs_view
```
